                            The mission of NC Sibs is to provide information, support, community, and a unified voice to advocate for other siblings and those with intellectual and developmental disabilities in an effort to improve quality of life for the entire family, promote
                            issues that are important to them, and create a more just world.

                          Through a partnership with the National Sibling Leadership Network and
                          funding from the North Carolina Council on Developmental Disabilities,
                          First In Families of North Carolina has created a statewide network for
                          adult siblings of individuals with developmental disabilities. NC Sibs is the
                          first ever network of its kind in North Carolina. The purpose is to connect
                          siblings with one another to provide support and information specific to the
                          unique aspects of the adult sibling relationship.
