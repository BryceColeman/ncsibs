Newsletter Blurb: 

NC Sibs is a statewide group of adult siblings of individuals with developmental disabilities and the genesis of NC’s very own chapter of the National Sibling Leadership Network. The purpose is to connect siblings with one another to provide support and information specific to the unique aspects of the adult sibling relationship. The network is currently being facilitated and grown by First In Families of NC as part of a three year initiative funded by the NC Council on Developmental Disabilities. NC Sibs seeks to provide support to adult siblings on a wide range of topics determined by members – some of the areas include future planning workshops, resource sharing and increased connectedness.
