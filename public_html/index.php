                    <p>NC Sibs is a statewide group of adult siblings of individuals
                      with developmental disabilities and the genesis of NC’s very own
                      chapter of the National Sibling Leadership Network. Created  by
                      First In Families of North Carolina with generous funding from the
                      North Carolina Council on Developmental Disabilities, its purpose
                      is to connect siblings with one another to provide support and
                      information specific to the unique aspects of the adult sibling
                      relationship. <a href="/about.php"><b>Learn more</b></a>
